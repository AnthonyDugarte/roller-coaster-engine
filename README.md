# Roller Coaster Engine

This project is a roller coaster construction engine that allows you to create and simulate custom roller coaster courses. The engine uses realistic physics to calculate the speed, acceleration, g-force and travel time of the trains on the circuit. The engine also offers a first-person view to experience the roller coaster from the passengers' perspective.

## Characteristics

- Intuitive graphical user interface to design the roller coaster circuit with different types of tracks, curves, loops, inversions and special elements.
- Option to view the roller coaster circuit in 3D with different camera angles and lighting modes.
- Option to simulate the movement of the train on the roller coaster circuit with graphs of speed, acceleration, g force and travel time.
- Option to activate or deactivate sound and music.

## Requirements

- Operating system: Windows, Linux or Mac OS X.
- Processor: Intel Core i5 or higher.
- Memory: 4 GB of RAM or higher.
- Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or higher.
- Disk space: 300 MB or greater.

## Installation

- Download the ZIP file of the project from the GitHub repository.
- Unzip the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.
- Change to the project directory
- Create a folder with the name 'build'
- Run the commands 'cmake..' and 'make'
- Run the file './RollerCoasterEngine

## Use

- To create a roller coaster course, click the "Play" button.
- To add a route to the circuit, select the "New" option.
- To modify an existing road, click on the road you want to change and move it with the camera.
- To delete a track from the circuit, click on the track you want to delete and select the "Delete" option.
- To view the roller coaster course from above, click on the "Map" option in the lower left corner of the screen and use the mouse and keyboard to change the camera angle and lighting mode.
- To simulate the movement of the train on the roller coaster circuit, click the "Simulate" button in the lower right corner of the screen and observe the speed, acceleration, g-force and travel time graphs in the lower panel.
- To experience the roller coaster from the passengers' perspective, click the "First Person View" button in the lower right corner of the screen and enjoy the ride.
- To turn sound and music on or off, click the "Settings" button in the lower left corner of the screen and select the option you prefer.
